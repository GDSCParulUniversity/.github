Here is a quick explanation of the above commands

```bash
git pull -v
```
the pull option is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.


```bash
git add -A
```
add option is used to add files to the staging area. `-A` option is used to add all the files in the current directory.

> Stagging area is a place where all the files are stored before they are committed. ( like a launch station for rocket ðŸš€)

```bash
git commit -v -m "Changes to repo"
```
commit option is used to commit the changes to the local repository. `-v` option is used to show the diff of the changes. `-m` option is used to add a message to the commit.

> messages are important to a commit cause it explains what changes are being made.

```bash
git push
```
push option is used to push the changes to the remote repository. which updates the remote repository with the changes made in the local repository.
